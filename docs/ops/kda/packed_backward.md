# Packed input windows for fused non-CP KDA backward

This increment adapts packed input loading from
[`primatrix/pallas-kernel` c82625a2bdadd5881b12f1ab37ec3fa2004c9780](https://github.com/primatrix/pallas-kernel/blob/c82625a2bdadd5881b12f1ab37ec3fa2004c9780/tops/ops/kda/chunk_bwd_mega.py)
to Tokamax's existing fused reverse traversal. It changes its Q/K/V/beta
input boundary while preserving aligned gates, matrix/state residuals,
normalization statistics and gradient outputs.

## Dispatch and data flow

`Config(packed_backward=True)` enables packed input windows when local
backward fusion is active, for non-CP packed calls with 128-aligned K/V.
Saved-state backward is supported directly. The rematerialized-state mode
also requires `fuse_rematerialization=True`; its reconstruction pass stays
aligned. Fixed-length, CP, disabled backward fusion and staged state
rematerialization retain their existing paths. The new option defaults false.

The Op VJP explicitly normalizes replayed original Q/K when normalization
is enabled. Original V and beta are reused directly. Per-chunk original
start/end metadata is derived from aligned segment IDs and both boundary
arrays. Invalid chunks receive an empty window. The reverse traversal uses
that metadata to read 72 rows at an eight-row-aligned packed origin, select
the 64-token chunk, and zero its sequence tail in VMEM. Guard rows protect
allocation-end loads. The existing local backward compute body receives
aligned VMEM tiles and keeps its established rounding behavior.

Head-group estimates include the extra window and staging buffers. The
implementation uses Pallas BlockSpec pipelining and element indices on all
input dimensions, consistent with TPU lowering requirements. It does not
import manual DMA scheduling from the source.

## Memory and numerical contract

The aligned residual tree is unchanged. Gate prefix recomputation, state
rematerialization, Q/K normalization backward and gradient unalignment still
use aligned data. Thus this is native packed input loading for the reverse
pass, not a complete native packed backward or removal of all aligned
training buffers. Original-input guards and repeated Q/K normalization also
have costs; only device measurement can establish the net benefit.

Output gradients, including padding and empty-state semantics, continue
through the existing postprocessing. FP32 v_new from rematerialized states
is still read from its aligned buffer, preserving the preceding PR's
precision contract.

## Validation and measurement

Tests compare full gradient trees in BF16/FP32 with packed forward enabled,
for saved and rematerialized states. Further cases cover every window offset,
non-eight-aligned source length, multiple head groups and batches, empty
batches, no initial/final state, preactivated gates and K/V=256. Dispatch tests
retain fixed-length, disabled-fusion and staged-rematerialization fallbacks.

```bash
python -m pytest tokamax/_src/ops/experimental/kda/pallas_mosaic_tpu_packed_bwd_test.py -v
python -m tokamax.benchmarks.kda --skip_implementations=xla,mosaic_staged,mosaic_fwd_fused,mosaic_fused,mosaic_packed_inputs,mosaic_remat,mosaic_remat_fused
```

Compare `mosaic_packed_outputs` and `mosaic_packed_backward`: forward input
loading, output compaction and saved-state policy are identical. Measure
forward+VJP with the default device timer and record hardware/JAX/JAXLIB/libtpu
versions. TPU lowering, allocation, device correctness and performance remain
pending. No speedup or memory reduction is claimed from CPU interpretation;
keep draft and keep the new option disabled until device validation completes.

Direct packed gradient stores and CP backward fusion remain separate work.
